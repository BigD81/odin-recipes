    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This family favourite marries meaty sausages with robust herbs and traditional, 
        comforting Yorkshire pudding</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>140g plain flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 Cumberland sausages</li>
        <li>8 sage leaves</li>
        <li>4 rosemary sprigs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. In a food processor, combine the flour, eggs, 
            milk, mustard and some salt and pepper, blitz until smooth, then leave to rest 
            for 30 mins.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the oil into a metal roasting tin about 30 x 23cm and 7.5cm deep. Brush the
            oil all over the sides and bottom, then place in the oven. When the roasting tin
            is very hot and smoking, place the sausages inside, evenly spread out, and cook
            for 5 mins.
        </li>
        <li>Give the rested batter a stir and pour into the really hot tin – take care as it 
            may spit. Quickly sprinkle over the sage leaves and rosemary, then place in the 
            middle of the oven. Do not open the door for 25 mins, then check – if needed, 
            cook for a further 5-10 mins. Cook until puffed up and brown and the batter is 
            completely cooked through. Serve straight from the dish.
        </li>
    </ol>
